HDFC Commercial Vehicle Loans: A
Comprehensive Analysis
HDFC Bank offers a robust suite of commercial vehicle financing solutions designed to meet the
diverse needs of businesses across India. These loan products provide financing options for
various types of commercial vehicles with competitive interest rates, flexible repayment terms,
and streamlined application processes. The following report presents a detailed examination of
HDFC's commercial vehicle loan offerings based on information available from their official
website and authorized sources as of March 2025.

Types of Commercial Vehicle Loans
HDFC Bank provides four distinct types of commercial vehicle financing solutions to cater to
different business requirements. Customers can choose from new commercial vehicle loans for
purchasing brand-new vehicles, used or refinance options for pre-owned vehicles, balance
transfer facilities for existing loans from other financial institutions, and top-up loans for
additional funding on existing commercial vehicle loans [1] . This comprehensive range ensures
that businesses at various stages of growth can find appropriate financing solutions tailored to
their specific needs.
The new commercial vehicle loan category represents the most straightforward option, allowing
businesses to purchase brand-new vehicles directly from manufacturers or authorized dealers.
This loan type typically offers the most favorable terms, including higher loan-to-value ratios and
longer repayment periods [1] [2] . For entrepreneurs looking to optimize their capital investment,
this option provides an effective way to acquire new assets while preserving working capital for
other business operations.
Used vehicle financing represents another significant category within HDFC's commercial vehicle
loan portfolio. This option enables businesses to purchase pre-owned commercial vehicles,
providing a cost-effective alternative for those with budget constraints. HDFC Bank finances
vehicles up to 15 years old under this scheme, though the maximum vehicle age at loan maturity
should not exceed 10 years [2] . The financing available for pre-owned vehicles typically covers
up to 90% of the total vehicle price, requiring the borrower to contribute the remaining portion
as a down payment [2] .
For customers with existing commercial vehicle loans from other financial institutions, HDFC
offers balance transfer facilities, allowing them to transfer their outstanding loan balances to
HDFC Bank, potentially benefiting from more favorable interest rates and terms [1] . This option
proves particularly valuable for businesses looking to consolidate their debt or reduce their
overall interest burden through more competitive rates.
Features and Benefits
HDFC Bank's commercial vehicle loans come with several attractive features designed to
provide maximum convenience and value to customers. One of the most notable benefits is the
high financing percentage offered by the bank. Depending on the specific loan type and the
customer's profile, HDFC provides up to 90% financing on standard commercial vehicle loans,
with special promotions occasionally offering up to 100% financing on select vehicles [3] [4] .
The repayment tenure flexibility represents another significant advantage of HDFC's commercial
vehicle loans. Customers can choose repayment periods ranging from 12 months to as long as
72 months (6 years), allowing them to structure their loan repayments according to their
business cash flows [3] [4] . This flexibility in tenure enables businesses to balance their monthly
financial obligations with operational requirements, ensuring sustainable debt management.
HDFC Bank also emphasizes quick processing and disbursal times for commercial vehicle loans.
The bank advertises a short turnaround time for loan approval and disbursal, helping customers
acquire their vehicles without unnecessary delays [1] . This efficiency in processing is particularly
valuable for businesses that need to quickly expand their fleet to meet growing operational
demands or capitalize on time-sensitive business opportunities.
Another significant feature of HDFC's commercial vehicle loan offering is the doorstep service
provided to customers. This convenience-oriented approach saves valuable time for business
owners by bringing the loan application and documentation process directly to them, eliminating
the need for multiple visits to bank branches [1] . Such service demonstrates HDFC's commitment
to customer convenience and operational efficiency.

Eligibility Criteria and Documentation
The eligibility criteria for HDFC Bank's commercial vehicle loans are designed to accommodate a
wide range of customer profiles. The bank caters to various segments, including large, medium,
and small-size fleet owners, individuals, first-time users, partnership firms, proprietorship firms,
and both private and public limited companies [5] . This inclusive approach ensures that
businesses of all sizes can access the financing they need for commercial vehicles.
While specific income requirements may vary based on the loan amount and type of vehicle
being financed, HDFC Bank generally requires applicants to demonstrate sufficient income
stability and repayment capacity. The bank evaluates the applicant's financial profile, including
credit history, existing financial obligations, and business performance, to determine loan
eligibility [3] [6] .
The documentation process for commercial vehicle loans at HDFC Bank is streamlined to
minimize paperwork while ensuring proper verification. Typically, applicants need to provide
identity proof, address proof, business details, and vehicle papers [3] . For self-employed
individuals and business owners, additional documents such as business registration certificates,
tax returns, and financial statements may be required to establish the business's financial health
and repayment capacity [6] .
Loan Amounts and Interest Rates
HDFC Bank offers commercial vehicle loans with competitive interest rates that vary based on
several factors, including the customer's profile, credit history, and the type of vehicle being
financed. As of March 2025, the interest rates for HDFC Bank's commercial vehicle loans range
from 7.92% to 16.07% per annum [2] . This wide range allows the bank to tailor its offering to
different risk profiles while remaining competitive in the market.
The loan amount available to customers depends on their financial eligibility and the value of the
vehicle being purchased. There is no specified upper limit on HDFC's commercial vehicle loan
amount, providing flexibility for businesses requiring financing for high-value commercial
vehicles [3] . However, the actual loan amount approved is typically determined based on the
customer's repayment capacity and credit assessment.
Processing fees represent an important cost component of commercial vehicle loans. HDFC
Bank charges up to 1.50% of the loan amount as a processing fee for commercial vehicle
loans [2] . However, the bank frequently offers promotional discounts on these charges, such as
the 50% waiver on processing fees mentioned in several sources [3] [4] . These promotions
provide significant cost savings for borrowers and enhance the overall value proposition of
HDFC's commercial vehicle financing solutions.

Types of Vehicles Covered
HDFC Bank provides financing for a comprehensive range of commercial vehicles to meet
diverse business transportation needs. The bank offers loans for vehicles ranging from 1.5-tonne
to 49-tonne Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW), encompassing virtually all categories of commercial
transport vehicles available in the Indian market [1] .
The bus category includes financing for intracity buses used for urban public transport, intercity
buses for longer routes between cities, school and college buses for educational institutions, and
staff buses for corporate employee transportation [1] . This diverse coverage ensures that
transportation businesses serving various passenger segments can access appropriate
financing solutions.
In the truck segment, HDFC finances small trucks, light trucks, medium trucks, heavy trucks,
and customized trucks designed for specific business applications [1] . This comprehensive
coverage allows logistics and transportation businesses to acquire precisely the right vehicles
for their operational requirements, whether for last-mile delivery or long-haul freight transport.
Specialized vehicles like tankers also qualify for HDFC's commercial vehicle financing. The bank
provides loans for various types of tankers, including milk tankers, water tankers, oil tankers,
chemical tankers, petroleum tankers, and gas tankers [1] . Other specialized commercial vehicles
covered include tippers for construction material transport, transit mixers for ready-mix concrete
delivery, and tempos for light goods transport.
HDFC Bank also maintains relationships with leading commercial vehicle manufacturers, allowing
customers to purchase vehicles from reputable brands such as Tata Motors, Eicher Motors,
Volvo, Mahindra Navistar, MAN, AMW, Mahindra & Mahindra, Swaraj Mazda, Bajaj Tempo, and
Ashok Leyland [1] . This wide coverage of manufacturers ensures that customers have access to
quality vehicles that meet their specific business requirements.

Application Process and Loan Management
The application process for HDFC Bank's commercial vehicle loans is designed to be
straightforward and user-friendly. Customers can apply through multiple channels, including
online applications via the bank's website, in-person applications at HDFC Bank branches, or
through doorstep service where bank representatives visit the customer's location [3] [6] .
The first step in the application process involves checking eligibility criteria, which customers
can find on the bank's official website or by inquiring at a bank branch [6] . Once eligibility is
confirmed, applicants need to complete the loan application form, providing accurate
information about themselves and the vehicle they intend to purchase.
After submitting the application form along with the required documents, HDFC Bank conducts a
verification process that includes credit assessment and vehicle valuation [6] . Upon successful
verification and approval, the loan is disbursed either directly to the vehicle dealer or to the
customer's account, depending on the specific arrangement.
For existing customers, HDFC Bank offers additional conveniences such as pre-approved loan
offers and simplified documentation requirements. The bank also provides various loan
management facilities, including online access to loan accounts, options for changing repayment
modes, and facilities for making prepayments or foreclosures [7] .

Fees and Charges
Understanding the fee structure is crucial for anyone considering a commercial vehicle loan from
HDFC Bank. The bank charges documentation fees of ₹650 per case, which are non-refundable
even in case of application cancellation [7] . Processing fees typically amount to up to 1% of the
loan amount, subject to a minimum of ₹3,500 and a maximum of ₹9,000, though special
promotions may offer discounts on these charges [7] .
For customers who wish to repay their loans ahead of schedule, HDFC Bank has specific policies
regarding prepayment. Partial prepayments are allowed twice during the loan tenure, providing
some flexibility for customers who wish to reduce their outstanding principal without fully closing
the loan [7] . For complete foreclosure, micro and small enterprises with fixed-rate loans up to ₹50
lakhs are exempted from prepayment penalties if the payment comes from their own sources [7] .
Late payment charges apply to customers who miss their EMI due dates. HDFC Bank charges
18% per annum (1.5% per month) on the overdue installment amount, plus applicable
government taxes [7] . Other miscellaneous charges include ₹500 for repayment mode changes,
₹250 for duplicate no-due certificates or NOCs, and ₹400 for loan reschedulement or
rebooking [7] .
